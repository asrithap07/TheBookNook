      <p class="blurb">The case is closed. Five years ago, schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by Sal Singh. The police

        by the murder, Pippa Fitz-Amobi isn't so sure. When she chooses the case as the topic for her final year
        project, she starts to uncover secrets that someone in town desperately wants to stay hidden. And if the real
        killer is still out there, how far will they go to keep Pip from the truth?
