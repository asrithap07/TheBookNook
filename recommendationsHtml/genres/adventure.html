      <p class="blurb">Laia, a slave, and Elias, a soldier, exist without freedom under the Martial Empire.
        Defiance means death, risking the lives of loved ones and all they hold dear. In this ruthless world,
        reminiscent
        of ancient Rome, Laia survives with her grandparents and brother, avoiding challenges to the Empire. However,
        when
        her brother is arrested, Laia must spy for rebels in exchange for their help in rescuing him, endangering her
        life
        within the Empire's prestigious military academy. There, she encounters Elias, the academy's top soldier who
        secretly desires freedom from tyranny. Together, their intertwined destinies will shape the Empire's future.

        a new hunt approaching in New York City, Lore is approached by two unexpected allies: Castor, a
        believed-to-be-dead childhood friend, and the wounded Athena, one of the few remaining original gods. They
        propose
        an alliance against their common enemy, offering Lore a chance to end the Agon forever. Yet, this decision comes
        with a deadly price, and it may not be enough to prevent the rise of a new god capable of enslaving humanity.
