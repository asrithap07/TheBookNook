      <p class="author Divergent"> Veronica Roth</p>
      <p class="blurb Divergent">In Beatrice Prior is on the brink of a decision that will change her life. In a society divided into factions everyone must decide where they belong. And Tris' choice surprises everyone, including herself.
        During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside
        her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests
        of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation
        transforms them, Tris must determine who her friends are—and where a romance with a
        sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret,
        one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest
        and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she learns that her secret
        might help her save those she loves . . . or destroy her.</p>

        <p class="gifted blurb"> 400 years after humanity nearly wiped out the earth, a lone city Paramus. Its
          founders believed that it was their intelligence that saved them, and so in Paramus, intelligence is valued

          Arin Wells is 18 years old and the only one who can take care of her family because she is Gifted. When the
          day comes that she must take the Criterion test, she will find out if she is smart enough to land them wealth
          and riches, or if her family will be exiled outside of the city’s walls forever.</p>

        <p class="hungerGames author">Suzanne Collins</p>
        <p class="blurb hungerGames">In the ruins of North America lies the nation of Panem,
          a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the
          districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to
          participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.
          Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death
          sentence when she takes her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead
          before—and survival is her second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she
          is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.

        <p class="legend blurb">What was once the western United States is now home to the Republic, a nation
          perpetually at war with its neighbors. Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest
          districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military
          circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may
          not be as malicious as they seem.
          From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths—until the day June's brother, Metias,
          is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race
          for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the
          two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go
          to keep its secrets.

 Deserts have taken over the land. Nuclear war has devastated humanity. Humans live in
          walled super cities to keep out the irradiated. What used to be America is divided into
          kingdoms ruled by royals.
          Sixteen-year-old Zea Calico, part of the lowest Echelon of the Kingdom of Phangloria, faces a life of
          hunger, thirst, and toil. The only way out of this drudgery is revolution, and Zea is desperate to help the cause. When the palace calls for candidates to compete to marry Prince Kevon, Zea joins the Princess Trials to
search the palace for weaknesses. The trials should be a fairytale of sumptuous meals, ballgowns, and romance, but one misplaced word causes Zea to attract the Prince's attention. When Zea uncovers the man beneath Prince Kevon's public facade, she risks falling in love and losing sight of her mission. But the televised beauty pageant turns deadly, and Zea must fight for survival.</p>

        <p class="redQueen author"> Victoria Aveyard</p>
        <p class="redQueen blurb"> Mare Barrow's world is divided by blood—those with common, Red blood serve the Silver-blooded elite, who are gifted with superhuman abilities. Mare is a Red, scraping by as a thief in a poor, rural village, until a twist of fate throws her in front of the Silver court. Before the king, princes, and all the nobles, she discovers she has an ability of her own.
To cover up this impossibility, the king forces her to play the role of a lost Silver princess and betroths her to one of his own sons. As Mare is drawn further into the Silver world, she risks everything and uses her new position to help the Scarlet Guard—a growing Red rebellion—even as her heart tugs her in an impossible direction.
One wrong move can lead to her death, but in the dangerous game she plays, the only certainty is betrayal.</p>

        <p class="renegades blurb"><em>Secret Identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He
            wants justice.</em>
          The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the
          ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of
          justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone... except the villains they once
          overthrew.
          Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer to
          her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova's
          allegiance is to a villain who has the power to end them both.</p>

          A world with no hunger, no disease, no war, no misery. Humanity has conquered all those things, and
          has even conquered death. Now scythes are the only ones who can end life—and they are commanded to do
          so, in order to keep the size of the population under control.
          Citra and Rowan are chosen to apprentice to a scythe—a role that neither wants. These teens must
          master the “art” of taking life, knowing that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own.

          opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of
          glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous
          Prince Maxon.
          But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love
          with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she
          doesn't want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.
          Then America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for
          herself—and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never

        Juliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days.
        The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No
        one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal. As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really
        cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases
        are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are
        the wrong color.
        The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a
        cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war—and The Reestablishment
        has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body.
        Maybe she's exactly what they need right now.
        Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.
