      <p class="blurb">The Blood Moon rises. The Blood Veil falls. The Tournament begins.
        Every generation, at the coming of the Blood Moon, seven families in the remote city of Ilvernath each name a
        champion to compete in a tournament to the death.
        The prize? Exclusive control over a secret wellspring of high magick, the most powerful resource in the
        world―one thought long depleted.
        But this year a scandalous tell-all book has exposed the tournament and thrust the seven new champions into the
        worldwide spotlight. The book also granted them valuable information previous champions never had―insight into
        the other families’ strategies, secrets, and weaknesses. And most important, it gave them a accept their fate or
        rewrite their legacy.</p>

        wants to hold her family together. Her mother is suffering from addiction and her brother is missing from the

        To combat her worries, Iris writes letters to her brother and slips them beneath her wardrobe door, where they

        back, the two of them forge a connection that will follow Iris all the way to the front lines of battle: for her
        brother, the fate of mankind, and love.</p>

One night, Vittoria misses dinner service at the family's renowned Sicilian restaurant. Emilia soon finds the body of her beloved twin...desecrated beyond belief. Devastated, Emilia sets out to find her sister's killer and to seek vengeance at any cost—even if it means using dark magic that's been long forbidden.
Then Emilia meets Wrath, one of the Wicked—princes of Hell she has been warned against in tales since she was a child. Wrath claims to be on Emilia's side, tasked by his master with solving the series of women's murders on the island. But when it comes to the Wicked, nothing is as it seems...

Desperate to stop the wedding and to heal her wounded heart, Evangeline strikes a deal with the charismatic but wicked Prince of Hearts. In exchange for his help, he asks for three kisses, to be given at the time and place of his choosing.
But after Evangeline’s first promised kiss, she learns that bargaining with an immortal is a dangerous game—and that the Prince of Hearts wants far more from her than she’d pledged. He has plans for Evangeline, plans that will either end in the greatest happily ever after or the most exquisite tragedy...

      <p class="author">Olive Black</p>
   <p class="blurb">In a world similar to our own, magicians of high caliber called medeians wield specialized magic, such as naturalists who can grow plants, physicists who can manipulate matter, empaths who can influence emotions, and illusionists who can disguise people’s appearances. Six of these medeians are recruited by Atlas Blakely, a mysterious Caretaker who invites them to train in order to be initiated into the Alexandrian Society. The Society, which has been secretly taking care of the archives of the Great Library of Alexandria after it faked its destruction to escape human greed, initiates five out of the best six medeians in the world every 10 years.
The newest recruits are Libby and Nico, two physicists, Callum, an empath, Tristan, an illusionist, Reina, a naturalist, and Parisa, a telepath. Over a year, while living in the Society’s house, they learn about the Society’s history and hone their specialties while experimenting with time, space, and thought. Eventually, they learn that for five of them to be initiated, the sixth must die.

   <p class="blurb"><strong> Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.
And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.</strong>
Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.
To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.
As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</p>

      <p class="author">Tahereh Mafi</p>
   <p class="blurb"><b>Clashing empires, forbidden romance, and a long-forgotten queen destined to save her people—Tahereh Mafi’s first in an epic, romantic trilogy inspired by Persian mythology.</b>
To all the world, Alizeh is a disposable servant, not the long-lost heir to an ancient Jinn kingdom forced to hide in plain sight.
The crown prince, Kamran, has heard the prophecies foretelling the death of his king. But he could never have imagined that the servant girl with the strange eyes, the girl he can’t put out of his mind, would one day soon uproot his kingdom—and the world.
Perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo, Tomi Adeyemi, and Sabaa Tahir, this is the explosive first book in a new fantasy trilogy from the New York Times bestselling and National Book Award-nominated author Tahereh Mafi.</p>
