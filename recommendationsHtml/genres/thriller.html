      <h2 class="tCuz title">The Cousins</h1>
        <p class="tCuz author"> Karen M. McManus</p>
        <p class="tCuz bookDescrip">Milly, Aubrey, and Jonah Story are cousins, but they barely know each other, and they've never even met their grandmother. Rich and reclusive, she disinherited their parents before they were born. So when they each receive a letter inviting them to work at her island resort for the summer, they're surprised... and curious.
Their parents are all clear on one point—not going is not an option. This could be the opportunity to get back into Grandmother's good graces. But when the cousins arrive on the island, it's immediately clear that she has different plans for them. And the longer they stay, the more they realize how mysterious—and dark—their family's past is.
The entire Story family has secrets. Whatever pulled them apart years ago isn't over—and this summer, the cousins will learn everything.</p>

But this year, the girls are returning to camp as counselors before heading off to college in the fall. And Goldie fears seeing her best friends again because she’s been keeping a horrible secret from them – one that has ruined her chances at a future. When a deady body is found at Camp Alpine Lake, the girls question wheter they trully know each other.

      <p class="enemy bookDescrip">
When the sickness came, every parent, police officer, politician - every adult fell ill. The lucky ones died. The others are crazed, confused and hungry.
Only children under fourteen remain, and they're fighting to survive.

      <h5 class="ivies title">The Ivies</h5>
      <p class="ivies author"> Alexa Donne</p>
      <p class="ivies bookDescrip">Everyone knows the Ivies: the most coveted universities in the United States. Far more important are the Ivies. The Ivies at Claflin Academy, that is. Five girls with the same mission: to get into the Ivy League by any means necessary. I would know. I'm one of them. We disrupt class ranks, club leaderships, and academic competitions...among other things. We improve our own odds by decreasing the fortunes of others. Because hyper-elite competitive college admissions is serious business. And in some cases, it's deadly.
Alexa Donne delivers a nail-biting and timely thriller about teens who will stop at nothing to get into the college of their dreams. Too bad no one told them murder isn't an extracurricular.</p>

Anna bears an eerie resemblance to Zoe, and her presence in town stirs up raw feelings about the unsolved case. As Anna delves deeper into the mystery, stepping further and further into Zoe's life, she becomes increasingly convinced that she and Zoe are connected-and that she knows what happened to her.
Two months later, Zoe's body is found in a nearby lake, and Anna is charged with manslaughter. But Anna's confession is riddled with holes. Martina Green, teen host of the Missing Zoe podcast, isn't satisfied. Did Anna really kill Zoe?</p>

      <p class="tNaturals bookDescrip">Years ago, Cassie's mother was killed, but her body was never found. This has haunted Cassie through childhood and into her teens, and she misses her mother very much. She lives with her grandmother but feels she doesn't belong. So, when the FBI recruits Cassie because of her "natural" ability to gauge people's emotions and background information just from looking at them, she jumps at the chance to change her life. She ends up living in Virginia with a group of other teens who have special abilities (e.g., pathological lying, mathematical deductive reasoning), whom the FBI believes will help solve cold murder cases. While solving a major case, Cassie hopes she also can find the answers to her mother's murder.</p>
