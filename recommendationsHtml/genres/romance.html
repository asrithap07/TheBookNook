  <p class="anatomy title">Anatomy: A Love Story</p>
<p class="anatomy author">Dana Schwartz</p>
  <p class="anatomy bookDescrip">Hazel Sinnett wants to be a surgeon more than a wife.
Jack Currer is a resurrection man who’s trying to survive when it’s easy to die.
When they have a chance encounter outside the Edinburgh Anatomist’s Society, Hazel thinks nothing of it. But after she gets kicked out of renowned surgeon Dr. Beecham’s lectures for being a woman, she realizes that her new acquaintance might be more helpful than she thought. Hazel made a deal with Dr. Beecham: passes the medical examination on her own, the university will allow her to enroll. Without real lessons, Hazel will need more than her books– she’ll need bodies to study, corpses to dissect.
Luckily she’s acquaintances with someone who digs them up for a living.
But Jack has his own problems: strange men have been seen skulking around cemeteries, his friends are disappearing. Hazel and Jack work together to uncover the secrets in the heart of their society.
A tale full of mystery and romance about a surgeon, a man who sells bodies for a living, and the buried secrets they must uncover.</p>

  <p class="bRead title">Beach Read</p>
  <p class="bRead author">Emily Henry</p>
  <p class="bRead bookDescrip">Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.
They’re polar opposites.
In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they’re living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer’s block.
Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no-one will fall in love. Really.</p>

  <p class="bTTMovies title"> Better Than The Movies</p>
  <p class="bTTMovies author">Lynn Painter</p> 
  <p class="bTTMovies bookDescrip">Liz Buxbaum always knew that Wes Bennett wasn't boyfriend material. You would think that her next-door neighbor would be a candidate for her romantic comedy fantasies, but Wes has only proven himself to be a pain, ever since they were little. Wes was the kid who put a frog in her Barbie Dreamhouse, the monster who hid a lawn gnome's severed head in her homemade neighborhood book exchange.
Flash forward ten years, it's Liz's senior year, a time meant to be rife with milestones perfect for any big screen, and she needs Wes's help. Liz's forever crush, Michael, just moved back to town, and he's hitting it off with Wes. Meaning that if Liz wants Michael to finally notice her, and be her prom date, she needs Wes. He's her in.
But as Liz and Wes scheme to get Liz her magical prom moment, she's shocked to discover that she actually likes being around Wes. And as they continue to grow closer, she must reexamine everything she thought she knew about love—and rethink her own perception of what Happily Ever After should look like.</p>

      <p class="tDP title">The Dating Plan</p>
    <p class="tDP author"> Sara Desai</p>
    <p class="tDP bookDescrip">Daisy Patel is a software engineer who understands lists and logic better than bosses and boyfriends. With her life all planned out, and no interest in love, the one thing she can't give her family is the marriage they expect. Left with few options, she asks her childhood crush to be her decoy fiance.
Liam Murphy is a venture capitalist with something to prove. When he learns that his inheritance is contingent on being married, he realizes his best friend's little sister has the perfect solution to his problem. A marriage of convenience will get Daisy's matchmaking relatives off her back and fulfill the terms of his late grandfather's will. If only he hadn't broken her tender teenage heart nine years ago...
Sparks fly when Daisy and Liam go on a series of dates to legitimize their fake relationship. Too late, they realize that very little is convenient about their arrangement. History and chemistry aren't about to follow the rules of this engagement.</p>

    <p class="eEvry title">Everything, Everything</p>
    <p class="eEvry author">Nicola Yoon</p>
    <p class="eEvry bookDescrip">My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, haven't left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.
But one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.
Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.

    <p class="gGComplex author">Elle Kennedy</p>
    <p class="gGComplex boookDescrip">Mackenzie "Mac" Cabot is a people pleaser. Her demanding parents. Her prep school friends. Her long-time boyfriend. It's exhausting always following the rules. Unlike most twenty-year-olds, all she wants to do is focus on growing her internet business, but first she must get a college degree at her parents' insistence. That means moving to the town of Avalon Bay, a community made of locals and the wealthy students of Garnet College.
Mac's had plenty of practice suppressing her wilder impulses, but when she meets local bad boy Cooper Hartley, that ability is suddenly tested. Cooper is rough around the edges. Raw. Candid. A threat to her ordered existence. Their friendship soon becomes the realest thing in her life.
Despite his disdain for the trust-fund kids he sees coming and going from his town, Cooper realizes Mac isn't just another rich clone and falls for her. Hard. But as Mac finally starts feeling accepted by Cooper and his friends, the secret he's been keeping from her threatens the only place she's ever felt at home.</p>

But as the tasks escalate from petty scandals to actual crimes, Alice must decide if it’s worth losing her conscience—or even her life.

    <p class="mMR author"> Alexene Farol Follmuth</p>
    <p class="mWR bookDescrip">Bel would rather die than think about the future. College apps? You’re funny. Extracurriculars? Not a chance. But when she accidentally reveals a talent for engineering at school, she’s basically forced into joining the robotics club. Even worse? All the boys ignore Bel—and Neelam, the only other girl on the team, doesn't seem to like her either.
Enter Mateo Luna, captain of the club, who recognizes Bel as a potential asset—until they start butting heads. Bel doesn’t care about Nationals, while Teo cares too much. But as the nights of after-school work grow longer and longer, Bel and Teo realize they've made more than just a combat-ready robot for the championship: they’ve made each other and the team better. Because girls do belong in STEM.

  <p class="aPLStory title">A Pho Love Story</p>
  <p class="aPLStory author"> Loan Le</p>
  <p class="aPLStory bookDescrip"> If Bao Nguyen had to describe himself, he’d say he was a rock. Steady and strong, but not particularly interesting. His grades are average, his social status unremarkable. He works at his parents’ pho restaurant where he is his parents’ fifth favorite employee.
If Linh Mai had to describe herself, she’d say she was a firecracker. Full of potential for joy and fire. She loves art and dreams pursuing an art career. The only problem? Her parents rely on her in ways they’re not willing to admit, like working almost full-time at her family’s pho restaurant.
For years, the Mais and the Nguyens have been at odds, having owned competing, neighboring pho restaurants. Bao and Linh, who’ve avoided each other for most of their lives, suspect that the feud stems from feelings much deeper than friendly competition.
A chance encounter brings Linh and Bao in the same vicinity, leading them both to wonder what took so long for them to connect. But then they immediately remember.
Can Linh and Bao find love between feuding families and complicated histories?

She doesn't believe anything will come of it- she's an only child, her mom is an orphan, and her dad died in Seoul before she was born. It's been just Chloe and her mom. But the DNA test reveals something Chloe never expected- she's got family from her father's side in Korea. Her father's family are owners of a famous high-end department store, and are among the richest families in Seoul. When they learn she exists, they are excited to meet her. Her mother has huge reservations which is why she's kept them secret, but she can't stop Chloe from going to Seoul to spend two weeks getting to know her family.
Chloe is whisked into the luxury, but something feels wrong. Chloe ignores it- she's busy enjoying the delights of Seoul with Miso Dan, the daughter her mother's grade school friend. But Chloe will discover why her mother never told her about her dad's family, and why the Nohs wanted her in Seoul. Could joining the Noh family be worse than having no family?</p>

    <p class="tTTmmrw title">Today, Tonight, Tomorrow</p>
  <p class="tTTmmrw author"> Rachel Lyn Soloman</p>
  <p class="tTTmmrw bookDescrip">Today, she hates him.
It’s the last day of senior year. Rowan Roth and Neil McNair have been bitter rivals for all of high school, clashing on test scores, student council elections, and even gym class pull-up contests. While Rowan, who secretly wants to write romance novels, is anxious about the future, she’d love to beat her infuriating nemesis one last time.
Tonight, she puts up with him.
When Neil is named valedictorian, Rowan has only one chance at victory: Howl, a senior class game that takes them all over Seattle, a farewell tour of the city she loves. But after learning a group of seniors is out to get them, she and Neil reluctantly decide to team up until they’re the last players left—and then they’ll destroy each other.
As Rowan spends more time with Neil, she realizes he’s much more than the  awkward linguistics nerd she’s sparred with for the past four years. And, perhaps, this boy she claims to despise might actually be the boy of her dreams.
Tomorrow … maybe she’s already fallen for him.</p>
